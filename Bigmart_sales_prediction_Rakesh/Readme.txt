# Big Mart Sales prediction problem
# This project will help to solve any linear regression problem in a simple way using keras as the base library.
# Thanks to Analytics Vidhya as I learned and derived most of the code based on their course work on computer vision.
# Many of the online resourses used regressors to solve this problem. But this project uses simple MLP to solve a regression problem on sales mart problem.

From the test and train data the "test_data_prediction.csv" and  "train_data_prediction.csv" 
files can be derived which can be visualised by debugging the "keras_training_rakesh.ipynb" file.
